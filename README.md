1. Introduction

The purpose of this project is to simulate the performance of a system that uses
proximity information collected through the bluetooth of smartphones to create
a graph database in which statistical properties of this information can be interpreted
in terms of the possible propagation of a virus.

2. Structure

The project is made of three logical units:

- Simulator of person mobility in a city

- Python-based API to communicate information to the graph data-base

- Graph Data-base server

- Python-based application to query information from the database
